# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Vehicle-Fuel-Efficiency-Optimization
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize vehicle parameters for improved fuel efficiency. By simulating evolutionary processes such as selection, crossover, and mutation, the algorithm searches for the most fuel-efficient configuration across a range of vehicle parameters.
